Do you ever feel like a plastic bag,
Drifting through the wind wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel,
Feel so paper thin like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
6 feet under screams but no one seems to hear a
Thing Do you know that there's still a chance for you '
Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta ignite, the light,
And let it shine Just own the night like the 4th of July

Cause baby you're a firework Come on,
Show 'em what you're worth Make 'em go "
Oh, oh, oh" As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework Come on, let your colors burst Make 'em go "
Oh, oh, oh" You're gonna leave 'em falling down-own-own
You don't have to feel like a waste of space You're original,
Cannot be replaced If you only knew what the
Future holds After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe your reason why all the doors are closed So you could open one
That leads you to the perfect road Like a lightning
Bolt, your heart will blow And when it's time, you'll know
You just gotta ignite, the light,
And let it shine Just own the night like the 4th of July
Cause baby you're a firework Come on,
Show 'em what you're worth Make 'em go "
Oh, oh, oh" As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework Come on, let your colors burst Make 'em go "
Oh, Oh, Oh" You're gonna leave 'em falling down-own-own
Boom, boom, boom Even brighter than the moon, moon,
Moon It's always been inside of you, you,
You And now it's time to let it through-ough-ough
Cause baby you're a firework Come on,
Show 'em what you're worth Make 'em go "
Oh, Oh, Oh" As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework Come on, let your colors burst Make 'em go "
Oh, Oh, Oh" You're gonna leave 'em falling down-own-own
Boom, boom, boom Even brighter than the moon, moon,
Moon Boom, boom, boom Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
